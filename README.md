# Surf Shop Analysis
## Purpose
Gathering weather data in Oahu for the months of June and December over a specific year range, in order to provide insight on weather appropriateness/business sustainability for a potential surf & ice cream shop on the island.

## Results 
Results from the analysis revealed that:
- Average temperature through both months are in a desirable range (i.e 74.9°F in June, and 71°F in December).
- Max temperatures through both months are also in a desirable range (85°F in June, 83°F in December). 
- Minimum temperatures through both months are slightly undesirable, but workable (64°F in June, 56°F in December). 

(Reference both tables below - top table is in reference to June temperatures, bottom to December).
